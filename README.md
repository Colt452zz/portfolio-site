# Personal Portfolio Website

*This is my personal portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It will be used to experiment with UI, game logic, and progressive feature unlocking. It is an ongoing project that will be expanded over time.*

## Features:

- progressive feature unlocking using JavaScript state
- interactive navbar with dropdown menus
- math-gated interaction logic
- multiple planned game pages (chess, platformer, tic-tac-toe)
- responsive, themed UI

## Tech Stack:

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox, positioning, theming)
- Vanilla JavaScript (DOM manipulation, state management)
- Git / Github for version control

## To run locally:
