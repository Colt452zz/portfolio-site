Title:

Personal Portfolio Website

Description:

This is my personal portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It will be used to experiment with UI, game logic, and progressive feature unlocking. It is an ongoing project that will be expanded over time.

Features:

- progressive feature unlocking using JavaScript state
- interactive navbar with dropdown menus
- math-gated interaction logic
- multiple planned game pages (chess, platformer, tic-tac-toe)
- responsive, themed UI

Tech Stack:

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox, positioning, theming)
- Vanilla JavaScript (DOM manipulation, state management)
- Git / Github for version control

To run locally:

Clone the repo and open index.html in a browser.

Future plans:

- add fully playable games
- improve animations and transitions
- Persist progress using localStorage
- expand About Me section
